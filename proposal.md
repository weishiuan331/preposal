# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

stock prediction

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A model that predict the stock's performance.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

To abstract 10 years data of stock price, and use the first 5 years stock price data to generate the model. Then use our model to predict the remaining five years data. If our output match the true data, and we'll recommend everyone to use our model to predict the stock performance.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

No

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

The graph of the historical stock price

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Our model can fit the remaining five years data

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Our model can predict future stock price

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

LSTM fuction or polynomial regression or Monte Carlo simulation.
We'll do it together.
